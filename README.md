# [Project 1: Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Prediction](https://github.com/pavanipragada/Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Prediction)

* Developed a predictive model optimizing loan approval processes for individuals with limited credit history.
* Key contributions include organizing project content, handling categorical data, and implementing normalization techniques.
* The solution ensures the identification of high-repayment customers, leading to increased revenue and proactive risk management.
* The project enhanced my data science skills and provided valuable real-time banking sector experience, contributing to a robust foundation for future endeavors.

# [Project 2: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://github.com/pavanipragada/House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques)

* The project tackles the challenge of accurately predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques.
* The primary concern is to provide a reliable model that can consider various factors influencing property values and generate precise predictions.
* To address this, the project leverages a dataset from the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" Kaggle competition.
* Through meticulous data preprocessing and the application of advanced regression models, the solution aims to develop a robust predictive model for house prices.
* This model intends to offer valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of the real estate market, aiding in informed decision-making for potential homebuyers and sellers.

# [Project 3: Regression - MovieMagic Concession Sales Analysis](https://github.com/pavanipragada/MovieMagic-Concession-Sales-Analysis)
# Project Overview:
* This repository contains an in-depth analysis conducted for MovieMagic, a movie chain in the southwest region. The project aims to identify factors influencing concession sales and improve the prediction of the amount spent on concessions. The analysis involves three main components:
## Linear Regression Analysis:
* Determine significant predictors influencing concession spending.
* Identify multicollinearity among predictors.
* Assess positive and negative influences of predictors on the amount spent.  
## Penalized Regression Analysis:
* Evaluate relevant variables for predicting concession sales.
* Compare the effectiveness of Ridge and LASSO in selecting relevant predictors.
* Analyze how different data splits (70-30 vs. 80-20) influence regression metrics.
## Text Analysis:
* Visualize customer reviews through word clouds for different star ratings.
* Implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling.
* Provide business strategy recommendations based on the inferred topics.

# [Project 4 : Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) - Census Data](https://github.com/pavanipragada/EDA-Census-Data)

* This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a small dataset containing population data of 50 US states and 2 territories (District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) for the years 2010-2019.
* The dataset is stored in the file census_statespop.csv, which is included in the repository.
* The main objectives of this analysis are to demonstrate how to use Pandas for data pre-processing, manipulation, and munging.
* The dataset has some quirks, such as missing values in rows, columns, and duplicates, which will be addressed during the analysis.
* Additionally, the dataset includes a column titled 'Region' indicating whether the state belongs to one of four census regions â€“ Northeast, South, Midwest, and West.
