# [Project 1: Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Prediction](https://github.com/pavanipragada/Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Prediction)

* Developed a predictive model optimizing loan approval processes for individuals with limited credit history.
* Key contributions include organizing project content, handling categorical data, and implementing normalization techniques.
* The solution ensures the identification of high-repayment customers, leading to increased revenue and proactive risk management.
* The project enhanced my data science skills and provided valuable real-time banking sector experience, contributing to a robust foundation for future endeavors.

# [Project 2: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://github.com/pavanipragada/House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques)

* The project tackles the challenge of accurately predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques.
* The primary concern is to provide a reliable model that can consider various factors influencing property values and generate precise predictions.
* To address this, the project leverages a dataset from the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" Kaggle competition.
* Through meticulous data preprocessing and the application of advanced regression models, the solution aims to develop a robust predictive model for house prices.
* This model intends to offer valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of the real estate market, aiding in informed decision-making for potential homebuyers and sellers.

# [Project 3: Regression - MovieMagic Concession Sales Analysis](https://github.com/pavanipragada/MovieMagic-Concession-Sales-Analysis)

* Performed an in-depth analysis for MovieMagic, a southwest movie chain, aiming to improve predictions of concession sales and identify key influencing factors.
* The analysis includes three primary components: Linear Regression Analysis, Penalized Regression Analysis (utilizing both Ridge and Lasso methods), and Text Analysis employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

# [Project 4 : Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) - Census Data](https://github.com/pavanipragada/EDA-Census-Data)

* This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a small dataset containing population data of 50 US states and 2 territories (District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) for the years 2010-2019.
* The dataset is stored in the file census_statespop.csv, which is included in the repository.
* The main objectives of this analysis are to demonstrate how to use Pandas for data pre-processing, manipulation, and munging.
* The dataset has some quirks, such as missing values in rows, columns, and duplicates, which will be addressed during the analysis.
* Additionally, the dataset includes a column titled 'Region' indicating whether the state belongs to one of four census regions â€“ Northeast, South, Midwest, and West.
